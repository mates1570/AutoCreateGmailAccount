After download the folder extract it and open cmd and enter python if you installed python you will find the python version(if latest version of python is available means download it..)

open cmd and enter  
pip install -r requirements.txt

download the chromedriver(https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads extract these to downloaded folder)and with matches your chrome version of your pc and

in g.py file replace phone number in 57 line or use online otp number after in otp section you must enter otp within 15 seconds remainig process will go automatic.

enter g.py in that particular folder in cmd or double click on g.py file

You do not need to do anything here. It automaticlly generates popular names for creating gmail accounts. There is only one thing that I need remind you. Username should be <u>Firstname + Lastname + 5 numbers</u>  Sometimes, Username would be mistook to be very long.

👉Note:-

👉if your selenium version is in latest version then the code never run
